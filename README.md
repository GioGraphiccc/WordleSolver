# WordleSolver
Here is my version of a code that can solve worlde puzzles. Its kinda basic but ye.
It can most likely find the answer to the worlde in 4 - 5 tries.

If you want to add more words go to WordList.txt and add it from the bottom there.
NOTE: Make sure you type enter for every word including the last one or the program wont work.
(Every word requires a newline char at the end and im too lazy to fix that)

HOW TO USE:
1. When the progrm starts it prompts you to type in any five letter word.
2. Input the starter word in wordle as well
3. Refer back to the program to submit any green letters, gray letters, or yellow letter seen in the wordle app.
4. After completing step 3 it will grant you a random word from a list that could be used in the app. Input that word in the wordle app
5. Repeat step 3 and 4 until an answer has been found.
